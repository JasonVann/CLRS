1.2-1 Given an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level.

A: Google map: it uses the shortest path algorithm to list routes from A to B; Since the user have the option to sort by time, cost, distance, or by mode(bus, drive, walk), it may use different weights for different factors. For traffic mode, it may have slightly different models for the road.

1.2-2 Whe does insertion sort (8\*n\*\*2) beats merge sort(eg. 64\*n\*log(n))

A: n = 26

1.2-3 When does an algorithm of 100\*n\*\*2 runs faster than 2\*\*n on the same machine?

A: n = 15
